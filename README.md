# Timesheet

This is a timesheet app for myself to keep track on my time when working on side projects.

The core premise is each calendar day has zero or many "TimeWorked" and each ItemWorked is connected to a Project.

### Domain
- Project
	- Id
	- Name

- TimeWorked
	- Id
	- ProjectId
	- Date
	- HoursWorked
	- Notes


### Future

The idea is just to use it myself and grow the project as needed.
And along the way document each step.
But that remains to be seen...
